1. `composer init`: Initializes a new `composer.json` file to start managing dependencies for a project.

2. `composer install`: Installs all the dependencies listed in the `composer.json` file for the current project.

3. `composer require`: Adds a new package as a dependency for the project. For example: `composer require package-name`.

4. `composer update`: Updates the dependencies specified in the `composer.json` file to their latest versions, respecting the version constraints.

5. `composer remove`: Removes a package from the project's dependencies. For example: `composer remove package-name`.

6. `composer show`: Displays the list of installed packages and their versions.

7. `composer outdated`: Shows a list of installed packages that have newer versions available.

11. `composer validate`: Validates the `composer.json` file for syntax errors.

14. `composer global`: Used to manage global Composer packages.

15. `composer clear-cache`: Clears the Composer's internal cache.
